## Problem 1

Start by loading all the required packages.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ tidyverse 1.3.0 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.3.2     v purrr   0.3.4
    ## v tibble  3.0.3     v dplyr   1.0.2
    ## v tidyr   1.1.2     v stringr 1.4.0
    ## v readr   1.3.1     v forcats 0.5.0

    ## -- Conflicts --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

Create a data frame that will be used to calculate mean values.

``` r
mean_df <-
  tibble(
    num_vector = rnorm(10),
    logical_vector = num_vector > 0,
    char_vector = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    factor_vector = factor(c("cat", "dog", "fish", "cat", "cat", "fish", "dog", "dog", "dog", "fish"))
  )
```

Check whether a mean can be calculated for each vector in the data
frame.

``` r
mean(pull(mean_df, num_vector))
```

    ## [1] -0.02377323

``` r
mean(pull(mean_df, logical_vector))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(mean_df, char_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(mean_df, char_vector)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(mean_df, factor_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(mean_df, factor_vector)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

A mean can be calculated for the numerical vector and for the logical
vector, but not for the character vector or the factor vector. Type
coercion occurs for the logical vector which is important to understand.

Next, the logical, character, and factor vectors are converted to
numeric vectors.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(mean_df, logical_vector))
as.numeric(pull(mean_df, char_vector))
as.numeric(pull(mean_df, factor_vector))
```

The logical vector returns values of 0 and 1, which is the numeric
version of this Boolean, which explains why you can take the mean of a
logical vector and get a value between 0 and 1. The character vector
returns NA (not available) values because letters or words cannot be
converted to numbers. Finally, the factor vector returns values of 1, 2,
and 3, because R orders the factors numerically. However, you are not
able to take a mean of a factor vector because a value returned for this
would have no meaning or practical use.

Convert the logical vector to various types and multiply by the numeric
vector.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(mean_df, logical_vector)) * pull(mean_df, num_vector)
```

    ##  [1] 0.08005308 1.23466172 0.00000000 0.68402613 0.00000000 0.80457865
    ##  [7] 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.00000000

``` r
as.factor(pull(mean_df, logical_vector)) * pull(mean_df, num_vector)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(mean_df, logical_vector)), pull(mean_df, :
    ## '*' not meaningful for factors

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(mean_df, logical_vector))) * pull(mean_df, num_vector)
```

    ##  [1]  0.1601062  2.4693234 -0.2757277  1.3680523 -0.5156138  1.6091573
    ##  [7] -0.5001669 -0.2739415 -0.7096131 -0.7659889

The conversion from a logical vector to a factor results in TRUE/FALSE
values which cannot be multiplied by the numeric vector.

However, converting the logical vector to a factor vector and then to a
numeric vector does allow you to multiply by a numeric vector.

## Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The Penguins data set contains 8 variables and 344 observations. Several
are quite useful for consideration: flipper\_length\_mm has a mean value
of 200.92 and a standard deviation of 14.06. bill\_length\_mm has a mean
value of 43.92 and a standard deviation of 5.46. There are 3 species,
including Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo. Finally, the years for these
penguins range from 2007 to 2009.

``` r
print(ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point())
```
